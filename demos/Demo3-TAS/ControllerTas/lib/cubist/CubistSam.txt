To run CubistSam.exe from MSDOS:

  *  Make sure that you have run Cubist on your application to
     construct the kind of model that you want to use.

  *  Put CubistSam.exe in a directory mentioned in your PATH setting
     (or, alternatively, put a link to CubistSam.exe in the directory
     containing your application's data files).

  *  Change to the directory containing your application's data files.

  *  If the application filestem is `app', say, put the cases to be
     run through the model in the file app.cases in the same format
     as the app.data file.  If a case's target value is unknown, put
     `?' for the target value.

  *  The MSDOS command is

        CubistSam -f app [-p] [-e] [-i] [> output file]

     The -p option prints a copy of the Cubist model.

     The -e option shows estimated error bounds for each case.

     The -i option shows the nearest neighbors for each case.  (This
     option is ignored unless the Cubist model uses both rules and
     instances.)

     For example, to run CubistSam for application FOO and save the
     output in file DONE, the command is

        CubistSam -f FOO > DONE

  *  For each case in the .cases file the output shows the target
     value stated in the file and the value predicted by the model.

     If the -e option is used, estimated 95% error bounds in the
     form "+- error" are shown for the case.

     Finally, if the -i option is used, the case's nearest neighbors
     and their distances from the case are given.
