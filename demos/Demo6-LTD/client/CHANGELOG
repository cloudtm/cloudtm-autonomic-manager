* tpc-w_ESW_1.5

- Added rbe.EBTPCW0Factory class to support a read-only client interaction.  Just use factory 0 (with arg -t 0) to RBE shell client.

* tpc-w_ESW_1.4

- Corrected behaviour of the original implementation (by deadpixel.de) regarding the handling of SQLExceptions.  It just printed the stack trace and continued which caused a few NullPointers ahead.  It even showed to the test client this misbehaviour.  Now, when an SQLException occurs, the transaction is restarted.  This is similar to Transaction.withTransaction template method from JVSTM

- Removed the unnecessary Java synchronization code when creating new entries in the database, such as Order, Carts, etc.

* tpc-w_ESW_1.3

- Decreased the statistics buffer size just a little bit to fit in a laptop's memory

* tpc-w_ESW_1.2

- Increased the statistics buffer size


* tpc-w_ESW_1.1

- Updated main.properties to suggest a better webappDir default value
