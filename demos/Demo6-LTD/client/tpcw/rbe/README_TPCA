README_TPCA

This file describes briefly how to run TPC-A using the RBE.

The file, "README," in this directory provides more general
information about using the RBE.  Look there for more details.

Example command line (all one line, of course):

java rbe.RBE -EB rbe.EBTPCBFactory 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 -5 5 -TT 0.01 
   -OUT tpcb.m -RU 1 -MI 5 -RD 1

The general format is:

java rbe.RBE -EB rbe.EBTPCBFactory <num_cl> <minBID> <maxBID> <minTID> 
	<maxTID> <minAID> <maxAID> <minDelta> <maxDelta> 
   -TT  <think>
   -OUT <output_file> -RU <ramp_up> -MI <measure> -RD <ramp_down>

num_cl:              The number of clients, emulated browsers, or connections.
minBID, maxBID:      The range of random branch IDs produced.
minTID, maxTID:      The range of random account IDs produced.
minDelta, maxDelta:  The range of account deltas produced.
think:               EB think times range from 7s to 70s times this value.
output_file:         An output matlab file (required).
ramp_up:             Warm-up time before measuring interaction rate.
measure:             Length of time for measuring performance.
ramp_down:           Steady-state after measurment interval.

See README for more details about -TT, -OUT, -RU, -MI, and -RD.
