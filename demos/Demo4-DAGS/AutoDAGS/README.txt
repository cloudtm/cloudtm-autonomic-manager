AutoDAGS can be used to parse data files generated by the WPM and to run DAGS varing system configuration parameters.
To use AutoDAGS, the executable file generated by compiling DAGS must be placed withing the same folder of the executable file generated by compiling AutoDAGS.

Input parameters:
m and M : (mandatory) they specify the minimum and the maximum, respectively, timestamp of data generated by the WPM to be parsed.
f : (mandatory) it specifies the full path of the file (or the list of files) that contains data generated by the WPM to be parsed. Multiple files must be separated with a comma;
s and S: they specify the minimum and the maximum, respectively, number of nodes to be used in the simulation  .
c and C: they specify the minimum and the maximum, respectively, number of clients to be used in the simulation (default 1).
e : it specifies the number of transactions to be executed by each client in a simulation run (default: 10000).
d: it specifies the number of the data objects to be used in the simulation (default 100000)

Example usage:
AutoDAGS -m 1 -M 100000 -f data1.log,data2.log -s 1 -S 2 -c 1 -C 3 -e 100000 -d 500000


Considering the above example usage, files 'data1.log' and 'data2.log' will be parsed, including data whose timestamp is between 1 and 100000. 20 concurrent clients will be started in the simulation, each client will execute 100000 transactions whose data accesses are distributed over a set of 500000 data objects.

Simulation results:
The simulation results are stored in the file 'output.txt' and are divided on basis of transactional classes. Each line in the output file includes:

- number of clients,
- number of servers,
- degree of data replication,
- average transaction response time.
- transaction throughput, 
- transaction abort ratio,
